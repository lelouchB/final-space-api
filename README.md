## Installation ⭐

First, Clone this repo. Both the frontend and the backend need to be installed seperately.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lelouchB/final-space-api.git
```

For **frontend** run the following commands.
 
 ```bash
 cd frontend
 npm install
 npm run build
 ```
 It is important that frontend is installed first and a `build` directory is created since the backend serves this `build` folder. 
 
 For **backend** run the following commands.
 
 ```bash
 cd backend
 npm install
 ```
 ## Starting the Development Server
 
 Run the following command in the backend directory to start the development server at `PORT=8000` by default.
 
 ```bash
 cd backend
 npm run dev
 ```
 
 This will start the development server at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
 **Note :** If `build` folder doen't exist you will see an error at the baseURL i.e. `/`. Create the `build` folder to fix this issue.
