Final Space API is a RESTful  API based on the animated television show [Final Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Space).


### Who am I? I am Spiderman

Hey Stranger 👋

I am [Ashutosh K Singh](https://twitter.com/noharashutosh), a JavaScript Dev and Technical Writer who loves building awesome things and writing about them. 


I binged **Final Space** a few months back and fell in love with it. Chookity! Chookity! But didn't thought much of it. It was [Colby Fayock](https://www.colbyfayock.com/) who suggested to build an API for this amazing show. Thanks a lot for that Colby.

This API was inspired by [The Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com).

Following are the tools and servies I used to create this API.

**Tech Stack**

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Server.
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) - Schema Modeling.
- [Docusaurus](https://v2.docusaurus.io/) -  For documentation of the API.
  

**Services**
