Final Space API is a RESTful  API based on the animated television show [Final Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Space).


### Who am I? I am Spiderman

Hey Stranger 👋

I am [Ashutosh K Singh](https://twitter.com/noharashutosh), a JavaScript Dev and Technical Writer who loves building awesome things and writing about them. 


I binged **Final Space** a few months back and really liked it. Chookity! Chookity! But didn't thought much of it. 

It was [Colby Fayock](https://www.colbyfayock.com/) who suggested to build an API for this amazing show. Thanks a lot for that Colby.

This API was inspired by [The Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com).

### What I Used?
Following are the tools and services I used to create this API.

**Tech Stack**
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Server.
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) - Schema Modeling.
- [Docusaurus](https://v2.docusaurus.io/) -  For documentation of the API.
  

**Services**
- [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/209c5b75f34f) - One droplet ($5 month)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - Free Cluster (Will upgrade based on future needs.)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/lelouchB/final-space-api) - Obviously !
- [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) - For `finalspaceapi.com` domain.
