### Get a single episode

You can get a single episode by adding the `id` as a parameter: `/episode/15`

```
https://finalspaceapi.com/api/v0/episode/15

  "id": 15,
  "name": "The Notorious Mrs. Goodspeed",
  "air_date": "06/22/2019",
  "director": "Yoriaki Mochizuki",

    "name": "Chapter 1",
    "air_date": "02/15/2018",
    "director": "Mike Roberts",

### Use limit with sort

You can limit and sort the response simultaneously by passing both `limit={number}` and `sort=desc` query parameters in the URL and seperating them with `&` operator.

```
https://finalspaceapi.com/api/v0/episode/?limit=3&sort=desc
```

```json
[
  {
    "id": 23,
    "name": "The Sixth Key",
    "air_date": "08/23/2019",
    "director": "Yoriaki Mochizuki",
    "writer": "Olan Rogers",
    "characters": [
      "https://finalspaceapi.com/api/v0/character/1",
      "https://finalspaceapi.com/api/v0/character/4",
